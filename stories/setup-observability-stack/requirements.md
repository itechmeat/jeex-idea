# Requirements Document â€” Story "Setup Observability Stack"

## Introduction

This story implements a comprehensive observability infrastructure for the JEEX Idea system using OpenTelemetry. The observability stack will provide distributed tracing, metrics collection, and structured logging across all services with proper project isolation through correlation IDs and project-based filtering.

## System Context

**System Name:** JEEX Idea Observability Stack
**Scope:** Telemetry collection, tracing, metrics, and monitoring infrastructure for all services

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-001: Distributed Tracing Infrastructure

**User Story Context:** As a developer, I want distributed tracing across all services so that I can monitor request flows and identify performance bottlenecks.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. The observability stack shall collect distributed traces from all services (API, PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant).
2. When a request is received by the FastAPI service, the observability stack shall generate a unique correlation ID and propagate it across all service calls.
3. While a request is processed, the observability stack shall create spans for database operations, vector searches, cache operations, and business logic execution.
4. When the observability collector receives telemetry data, it shall enrich the data with service context and project isolation attributes.
5. If the primary telemetry exporter fails, then the observability stack shall buffer the data and export to a fallback file storage.

**Rationale:** Distributed tracing is essential for understanding request flows across microservices and identifying performance issues or errors in the system.

### REQ-002: Correlation ID Management

**User Story Context:** As a developer, I want correlation IDs to be automatically generated and propagated so that I can track a single request across all system components.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. When an HTTP request is received by the API service, the correlation ID middleware shall generate a UUID v4 correlation ID if not present in the request headers.
2. The correlation ID middleware shall add the correlation ID to all span attributes, log entries, and outbound HTTP client calls.
3. While processing requests, the FastAPI service shall include the correlation ID in response headers for client-side debugging.
4. When database operations are executed, the correlation ID shall be included as a query parameter or session attribute for audit logging.
5. Where external service calls are made, the correlation ID shall be included in HTTP headers for end-to-end tracing.

**Rationale:** Correlation IDs enable tracking of requests across service boundaries and are essential for debugging complex multi-service interactions.

### REQ-003: Project-Based Data Isolation

**User Story Context:** As a system administrator, I want observability data to be isolated by project so that I can enforce data boundaries and provide project-specific monitoring.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. When telemetry data is collected, the observability stack shall tag all spans, metrics, and logs with the project_id from the request context.
2. The development dashboard shall filter all observability data based on the selected project_id to prevent cross-project data leakage.
3. While storing traces in the backend, the observability system shall maintain project isolation through metadata filtering.
4. When exporting telemetry data to external systems, the project_id shall be included as a required attribute for all records.
5. If a request lacks a valid project_id, then the observability stack shall reject the telemetry data and log a security warning.

**Rationale:** Project isolation is a critical security requirement to prevent accidental exposure of telemetry data between projects.

### REQ-004: Service Health Monitoring

**User Story Context:** As a developer, I want real-time health monitoring of all services so that I can quickly identify and respond to service failures.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. The observability stack shall collect health metrics from all services every 30 seconds including response time, error rate, and resource utilization.
2. When a service health check fails, the observability system shall generate an alert and update the service status to "unhealthy".
3. While a service is in degraded state (response time > threshold or error rate > threshold), the observability stack shall update the service status to "degraded".
4. The development dashboard shall display real-time service health status with visual indicators for healthy, degraded, and unhealthy states.
5. If a service remains unhealthy for more than 5 minutes, then the observability system shall send a notification to the development team.

**Rationale:** Health monitoring enables proactive detection of service issues and helps maintain system reliability.

### REQ-005: Metrics Collection and Aggregation

**User Story Context:** As a developer, I want comprehensive metrics collection so that I can monitor system performance and identify trends.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. The observability stack shall collect application metrics including request count, response time distribution, error rates, and resource utilization.
2. When database operations occur, the observability system shall record query execution time, connection pool usage, and query success/failure rates.
3. While Redis operations are performed, the observability stack shall capture cache hit/miss ratios, operation latency, and memory usage statistics.
4. The metrics collection system shall aggregate data by service name, project_id, and operation type with 1-minute intervals.
5. Where custom business metrics are defined, the observability system shall support manual metric registration and collection.

**Rationale:** Metrics provide quantitative insights into system behavior and performance trends over time.

### REQ-006: Development Dashboard Interface

**User Story Context:** As a developer, I want a web-based dashboard so that I can visualize observability data and debug issues without leaving the development environment.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. The development dashboard shall provide a web interface accessible at `/otel-dashboard` with real-time trace visualization and service health monitoring.
2. When the dashboard is accessed, it shall display a list of projects with filtering capabilities to isolate observability data by project.
3. While viewing traces, the dashboard shall show trace timelines with span details, service call graphs, and performance bottlenecks.
4. The dashboard interface shall include basic metrics charts for response times, error rates, and service health over configurable time ranges.
5. If observability data is unavailable, then the dashboard shall display appropriate error messages and retry automatically every 30 seconds.

**Rationale:** A development dashboard provides immediate visibility into system behavior without requiring external monitoring tools.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### PERF-001: Performance Overhead

While system is under normal load, the observability stack shall add less than 5% latency overhead to API requests and consume less than 512MB of memory for the collector service.

### PERF-002: Data Collection Throughput

When processing telemetry data, the observability collector shall handle at least 1000 spans per second without data loss and maintain batch processing with 1-second intervals.

### PERF-003: Dashboard Responsiveness

While displaying observability data, the development dashboard shall load trace data within 2 seconds and update real-time metrics with less than 1-second latency.

### SEC-001: Data Privacy and Security

If sensitive information is detected in telemetry data, then the observability stack shall automatically redact or mask the sensitive fields including authentication headers, user credentials, and personal identifiers.

### SEC-002: Access Control

When accessing the development dashboard, users shall be authenticated and authorized with project-scoped access controls to prevent viewing telemetry data from other projects.

### RELI-001: Collector Resilience

If the primary telemetry exporter becomes unavailable, then the observability collector shall buffer data for up to 5 minutes and automatically retry with exponential backoff.

### RELI-002: Service Independence

While observability infrastructure experiences failures, application services shall continue normal operation without blocking on telemetry collection or export.
