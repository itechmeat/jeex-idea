# Requirements Document — Story "Setup FastAPI Backend Foundation"

## Introduction

This document defines the formal requirements for the FastAPI backend foundation using the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) standard. The backend service serves as the core API layer that coordinates all operations, enforces security boundaries, maintains project isolation, and integrates with existing infrastructure components.

## System Context

**System Name:** JEEX API Service

**Scope:** The JEEX API Service encompasses the FastAPI application, middleware chain, database connection management, health check system, SSE streaming infrastructure, and OAuth2/JWT security mechanisms. The system boundary includes all HTTP endpoints exposed to clients and integrations with PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, and OpenTelemetry services.

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-001: FastAPI Application Initialization

**User Story Context:** As a system administrator, I want the FastAPI application to initialize correctly with all dependencies, so that the API service is ready to handle requests.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. When the application starts, the JEEX API Service shall create a FastAPI application instance with OpenAPI documentation enabled
2. When the application starts, the JEEX API Service shall register all middleware components in the correct order
3. When the application starts, the JEEX API Service shall register all API route handlers under the /api/v1 prefix
4. When the application starts, the JEEX API Service shall initialize OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation with service name "jeex-api"
5. When the application shuts down, the JEEX API Service shall gracefully close all database connections within 5 seconds

**Rationale:** Proper application initialization ensures all components are correctly configured before handling requests. Graceful shutdown prevents connection leaks and data corruption.

### REQ-002: Configuration Management

**User Story Context:** As a developer, I want configuration to be loaded from environment variables, so that I can deploy the same code to different environments without modifications.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. When the application starts, the JEEX API Service shall load configuration from environment variables using Pydantic BaseSettings
2. When the application starts, the JEEX API Service shall validate all required configuration parameters and raise an error if any are missing
3. The JEEX API Service shall support configuration for database URL, Redis URL, Qdrant URL, OTEL endpoint, secret key, and CORS origins
4. When configuration validation fails, the JEEX API Service shall log the specific missing parameters and terminate startup with exit code 1

**Rationale:** Environment-based configuration enables deployment flexibility while validation prevents runtime errors from misconfiguration.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md Components and Interfaces §2 (Configuration Management)

### REQ-003: Middleware Chain Execution

**User Story Context:** As a system operator, I want all requests to pass through security and isolation middleware, so that security policies are consistently enforced.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. When an HTTP request is received, the JEEX API Service shall execute middleware in the following order: correlation ID → security headers → CORS → authentication → project isolation → error handler
2. When a request contains an X-Correlation-ID header, the JEEX API Service shall use that value as the correlation ID
3. When a request does not contain an X-Correlation-ID header, the JEEX API Service shall generate a new UUID v4 correlation ID
4. When middleware processing completes, the JEEX API Service shall add the X-Correlation-ID header to the response
5. When any middleware raises an exception, the JEEX API Service shall catch it in the error handler middleware and return a standardized error response

**Rationale:** Consistent middleware execution ensures security policies, logging, and error handling are applied uniformly across all endpoints.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md Components and Interfaces §3 (Middleware Components)

### REQ-004: Database Connection Management

**User Story Context:** As a developer, I want efficient database connection pooling, so that the system can handle concurrent requests without connection exhaustion.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. When the application starts, the JEEX API Service shall create a PostgreSQL connection pool with minimum 10 and maximum 20 connections
2. When the application starts, the JEEX API Service shall create a Redis connection pool with maximum 50 connections
3. When the application starts, the JEEX API Service shall create a Qdrant async client instance
4. When a request handler requires a database connection, the JEEX API Service shall acquire a connection from the pool via dependency injection
5. When a request completes, the JEEX API Service shall return the database connection to the pool
6. When the application shuts down, the JEEX API Service shall close all connection pools gracefully

**Rationale:** Connection pooling prevents resource exhaustion and improves performance by reusing connections across requests.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md Components and Interfaces §4 (Database Connection Management)

### REQ-005: Health Check Endpoints

**User Story Context:** As a DevOps engineer, I want health check endpoints to monitor service status, so that I can configure Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. When a GET request is received at /health/live, the JEEX API Service shall return HTTP 200 with status "ok" if the application is running
2. When a GET request is received at /health/ready, the JEEX API Service shall check connectivity to PostgreSQL, Redis, and Qdrant
3. When all dependencies are healthy, the JEEX API Service shall return HTTP 200 from /health/ready with status "healthy"
4. When any dependency is unhealthy, the JEEX API Service shall return HTTP 503 from /health/ready with status "unhealthy" and details of failed components
5. When a GET request is received at /health, the JEEX API Service shall return detailed health status for each component including response time in milliseconds

**Rationale:** Health checks enable orchestration platforms to detect and respond to service degradation automatically.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md Components and Interfaces §5 (Health Check System)

### REQ-006: SSE Streaming Infrastructure

**User Story Context:** As a frontend developer, I want to receive real-time progress updates via SSE, so that users can monitor long-running operations.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. When a GET request is received at a streaming endpoint, the JEEX API Service shall establish an SSE connection with Content-Type text/event-stream
2. When an SSE connection is established, the JEEX API Service shall subscribe to Redis pub/sub channel for the project and operation
3. When an event is published to the subscribed Redis channel, the JEEX API Service shall format it as an SSE event and send to the client
4. When the client disconnects, the JEEX API Service shall unsubscribe from the Redis channel within 1 second
5. When no events are received for 30 seconds, the JEEX API Service shall send a keepalive comment to prevent connection timeout

**Rationale:** SSE streaming enables real-time updates without polling, reducing server load and improving user experience.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md Components and Interfaces §6 (SSE Streaming Service)

### REQ-007: OAuth2 and JWT Infrastructure

**User Story Context:** As a security engineer, I want JWT token validation infrastructure in place, so that protected endpoints can verify user authentication.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. The JEEX API Service shall provide a function to create JWT access tokens with RS256 algorithm and configurable expiration
2. The JEEX API Service shall provide a function to verify JWT tokens by validating signature, expiration, and issuer claims
3. When a JWT token is invalid or expired, the JEEX API Service shall raise an UnauthorizedError exception
4. The JEEX API Service shall provide an OAuth2PasswordBearer dependency that extracts bearer tokens from the Authorization header
5. The JEEX API Service shall provide a get_current_user dependency that validates the token and returns the authenticated user object

**Rationale:** JWT infrastructure prepares the backend for authentication implementation in Story 18, ensuring consistent token handling patterns.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md Components and Interfaces §7 (OAuth2/JWT Security Infrastructure)

### REQ-008: Base Repository Pattern

**User Story Context:** As a backend developer, I want a base repository pattern with project isolation, so that all database queries automatically filter by project_id.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. The JEEX API Service shall provide a BaseRepository class that accepts a SQLAlchemy model and database session
2. When a repository method is called with a project_id parameter, the JEEX API Service shall automatically add a WHERE clause filtering by project_id
3. When creating a new entity, the JEEX API Service shall validate that the entity's project_id matches the authenticated user's project context
4. When deleting an entity, the JEEX API Service shall perform a soft delete by setting deleted_at timestamp and is_deleted flag
5. When listing entities, the JEEX API Service shall exclude soft-deleted records unless explicitly requested

**Rationale:** Base repository pattern enforces project isolation at the data access layer, preventing cross-project data leakage.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md Components and Interfaces §8 (Base Repository Pattern)

### REQ-009: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story Context:** As a developer, I want consistent error responses with correlation IDs, so that I can debug issues across distributed systems.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. When an exception occurs during request processing, the JEEX API Service shall catch it in the global error handler middleware
2. When an exception is caught, the JEEX API Service shall log the error with correlation ID, stack trace, and request context
3. When an exception is caught, the JEEX API Service shall return a standardized error response with error type, message, status code, correlation ID, and timestamp
4. When a validation error occurs, the JEEX API Service shall return HTTP 422 with detailed validation error messages
5. When a JEEXException is raised, the JEEX API Service shall return the specified status code and message without exposing internal details

**Rationale:** Consistent error handling improves debuggability and prevents information leakage while providing useful error messages to clients.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md Error Handling Strategy

### REQ-010: OpenTelemetry Integration

**User Story Context:** As a site reliability engineer, I want distributed tracing for all requests, so that I can diagnose performance issues across services.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. When the application starts, the JEEX API Service shall initialize OpenTelemetry with auto-instrumentation for FastAPI, asyncpg, aioredis, and HTTP clients
2. When a request is received, the JEEX API Service shall create a root span with correlation ID as span attribute
3. When a database query is executed, the JEEX API Service shall create a child span with query type and duration
4. When an error occurs, the JEEX API Service shall mark the current span as error and record exception details
5. When a span completes, the JEEX API Service shall export it to the OpenTelemetry collector at the configured endpoint

**Rationale:** Distributed tracing enables observability across the entire request lifecycle, critical for debugging multi-agent workflows.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md Architecture Diagrams (Request Flow Sequence)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### PERF-001: Connection Pool Performance

While the application is running, the JEEX API Service shall maintain database connection pool utilization below 80% under normal load conditions.

**Rationale:** Connection pool headroom prevents connection exhaustion during traffic spikes and ensures consistent response times.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md Performance Considerations

### PERF-002: SSE Streaming Performance

While streaming events via SSE, the JEEX API Service shall limit memory usage per connection to 10 MB and disconnect clients exceeding this limit.

**Rationale:** Memory limits prevent resource exhaustion from slow or stalled clients consuming server resources.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md Components and Interfaces §6 (SSE Streaming Service)

### PERF-003: Health Check Response Time

When health check endpoints are called, the JEEX API Service shall return a response within 200 milliseconds at P95.

**Rationale:** Fast health checks enable rapid detection of service degradation by orchestration platforms.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md Components and Interfaces §5 (Health Check System)

### SEC-001: Security Headers

When returning an HTTP response, the JEEX API Service shall include Strict-Transport-Security, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and Content-Security-Policy headers.

**Rationale:** Security headers protect against common web vulnerabilities like XSS, clickjacking, and MIME sniffing attacks.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md Security Considerations

### SEC-002: Project Isolation Enforcement

When executing a database query, the JEEX API Service shall enforce project_id filtering at the repository layer to prevent cross-project data access.

**Rationale:** Server-side project isolation is mandatory per CLAUDE.md to prevent unauthorized data access.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md Security Considerations (Project Isolation)

### SEC-003: JWT Token Validation

When validating a JWT token, the JEEX API Service shall verify signature using RS256 algorithm, check expiration timestamp, and validate issuer claim.

**Rationale:** Comprehensive token validation prevents token forgery, replay attacks, and unauthorized access.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md Components and Interfaces §7 (OAuth2/JWT Infrastructure)

### SEC-004: CORS Configuration

When receiving a cross-origin request, the JEEX API Service shall validate the Origin header against a whitelist from configuration and reject requests from unlisted origins.

**Rationale:** Strict CORS policy prevents unauthorized websites from making requests to the API on behalf of authenticated users.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md Security Considerations (CORS Configuration)

### OBS-001: Correlation ID Propagation

When processing a request, the JEEX API Service shall propagate correlation ID through all service calls, database queries, and log messages.

**Rationale:** Correlation ID propagation enables end-to-end request tracing across distributed systems.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md Components and Interfaces §3 (Correlation ID Middleware)

### OBS-002: Structured Logging

When logging events, the JEEX API Service shall emit JSON-formatted log entries with timestamp, level, correlation_id, span_id, trace_id, and message fields.

**Rationale:** Structured logging enables automated log parsing, aggregation, and correlation with distributed traces.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md Architecture Diagrams

### REL-001: Graceful Degradation

If Redis is unavailable, the JEEX API Service shall continue serving requests without SSE streaming or rate limiting, and log a warning.

**Rationale:** Graceful degradation maintains core functionality when non-critical dependencies fail.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md Risks and Mitigations

### REL-002: Connection Retry Logic

If a database connection fails, the JEEX API Service shall retry the connection attempt up to 3 times with exponential backoff before returning an error.

**Rationale:** Transient network issues should not cause immediate failures; retry logic improves resilience.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md Risks and Mitigations
