# Requirements Document â€” Story "Setup Docker Development Environment"

## Introduction

This story establishes the complete Docker development environment infrastructure for JEEX Idea. The implementation will create a containerized development stack that provides all necessary services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, Nginx, OpenTelemetry) with proper networking, health checks, security configurations, and development tooling. This environment serves as the foundation for all subsequent development work and ensures consistent, reproducible development setups across different machines.

## System Context

**System Name:** Docker Development Environment
**Scope:** Containerized infrastructure services providing database, caching, vector search, reverse proxy, and observability capabilities for local development. The environment includes service orchestration, networking configuration, health monitoring, and development-specific optimizations.

## Functional Requirements

### INFRA-001: Docker Compose Service Orchestration

**User Story Context:** As a developer, I want a single command to start all development services, so that I can quickly begin development work.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. The Docker Compose configuration shall orchestrate all development services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, Nginx, API, OpenTelemetry) with proper dependency ordering.

2. When `docker-compose up --build` is executed, the Docker environment shall start all services in the correct sequence with health checks validating successful startup.

3. When a service fails its health check, the Docker environment shall automatically restart the service with exponential backoff and log the failure details.

4. Where environment variables are provided, the Docker Compose configuration shall use variable substitution for all configuration values (database URLs, passwords, ports).

5. If Docker Compose encounters a port conflict, then it shall display a clear error message indicating which ports are in use and how to resolve the conflict.

**Rationale:** Developers need a reliable, single-command development environment startup that handles service dependencies and provides clear feedback on failures.

### INFRA-002: Network Configuration and Service Isolation

**User Story Context:** As a developer, I want services properly networked with security boundaries, so that communication follows architectural patterns and prevents unauthorized access.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. The Docker environment shall create three separate networks: jeex-frontend, jeex-backend, and jeex-data with appropriate access controls.

2. While services are running, the jeex-frontend network shall only allow communication between Nginx and the API service.

3. When the API service needs to access data services, it shall use the jeex-backend network to communicate with PostgreSQL, Qdrant, and Redis services.

4. Where database services need additional isolation, the jeex-data network shall restrict access to only the API service and internal database operations.

5. If a service attempts to access an unauthorized network, then the Docker network configuration shall block the connection and log the security violation.

**Rationale:** Network segmentation prevents unauthorized service access and follows security best practices for containerized environments.
