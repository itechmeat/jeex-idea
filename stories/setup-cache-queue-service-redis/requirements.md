# Requirements Document â€” Story "Setup Cache and Queue Service (Redis)"

## Introduction

This story implements Redis as the cache and queue service for JEEX Idea, providing essential infrastructure for caching, rate limiting, task queuing, and real-time progress tracking. The Redis service will integrate with the existing Docker environment and support the multi-agent architecture with project-level isolation.

## System Context

**System Name:** Redis Cache and Queue Service
**Scope:** Redis 6.4.0+ configuration and integration for caching, rate limiting, task queuing, and progress tracking with project-level isolation

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-001: Redis Service Configuration

**User Story Context:** As a system administrator, I want Redis to be properly configured with optimal settings, so that the system has reliable caching and queuing infrastructure.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. The Redis service shall run on port 5240 with Redis 6.4.0+ as specified in docs/specs.md.
2. When the Docker environment starts, the Redis service shall initialize with memory limits and persistence configuration.
3. While the Redis service is running, it shall maintain connection pooling for API services with a minimum of 10 connections.
4. When health checks are performed, the Redis service shall respond within 100ms with service status information.
5. If Redis memory usage exceeds 80% of allocated limit, then the Redis service shall enable LRU eviction policy.

**Rationale:** Ensures Redis is properly configured and integrated into the existing Docker environment with performance monitoring.

### REQ-002: Cache Management

**User Story Context:** As a developer, I want reliable caching for project data and user sessions, so that API responses are fast and database load is reduced.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. The cache manager shall store project data with TTL of 3600 seconds using key pattern "project:{project_id}:data".
2. When project data is requested, the cache manager shall return cached data if available and not expired.
3. While a cache miss occurs, the cache manager shall fetch data from the database and store it in Redis with appropriate TTL.
4. When project data is modified, the cache manager shall invalidate all related cache keys for that project.
5. If cache operations fail, then the system shall fallback to direct database queries without service interruption.

**Rationale:** Provides efficient caching layer to improve performance and reduce database load.

### REQ-003: Rate Limiting

**User Story Context:** As a system administrator, I want rate limiting for users and projects, so that the system is protected from abuse and ensures fair resource usage.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. The rate limiter shall enforce user-level rate limits using sliding window algorithm with key pattern "rate_limit:user:{user_id}:{window}".
2. When a user exceeds their rate limit, the rate limiter shall reject the request with HTTP 429 status and retry-after header.
3. While API requests are processed, the rate limiter shall track token consumption per user with daily limits.
4. When project-level rate limits are configured, the rate limiter shall enforce limits using key pattern "rate_limit:project:{project_id}:{window}".
5. If rate limit data is unavailable in Redis, then the rate limiter shall allow requests with logging to prevent service disruption.

**Rationale:** Prevents abuse and ensures fair resource allocation across users and projects.

### REQ-004: Task Queue Management

**User Story Context:** As an agent orchestrator, I want reliable task queuing for background operations, so that embedding computation and agent tasks can be processed asynchronously.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. The queue manager shall maintain separate queues for embeddings, agent tasks, and exports using key patterns "queue:{queue_name}".
2. When tasks are queued, the queue manager shall store task data with priority level and creation timestamp.
3. While processing tasks, the queue manager shall update task status in "task:{task_id}:status" with timestamps.
4. When task processing fails, the queue manager shall implement exponential backoff retry with maximum 3 attempts.
5. If a task exceeds maximum retry attempts, then the queue manager shall move it to dead letter queue for manual review.

**Rationale:** Enables reliable background processing of computationally expensive operations.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md sections 3.4, 7.2

### REQ-005: Progress Tracking

**User Story Context:** As a user, I want real-time progress updates for long-running operations, so that I can monitor the status of document generation and agent interactions.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. The progress tracker shall initialize progress tracking with correlation ID using key pattern "progress:{correlation_id}".
2. When agent operations are in progress, the progress tracker shall update step progress with messages and timestamps.
3. While SSE connections are active, the progress tracker shall provide progress data for real-time updates to clients.
4. When progress tracking is complete, the progress tracker shall mark progress as completed and set expiry time.
5. If progress data is not updated for more than 30 minutes, then the progress tracker shall automatically clean up expired progress entries.

**Rationale:** Provides visibility into long-running operations and enhances user experience.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md sections 3.5, 4.3

### REQ-006: Session Management

**User Story Context:** As a user, I want persistent sessions across requests, so that I don't need to authenticate repeatedly and my work context is maintained.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. The session manager shall store user session data using key pattern "session:{session_id}" with TTL of 7200 seconds.
2. When a user authenticates successfully, the session manager shall create a session with user context and project access rights.
3. While session is active, the session manager shall validate session on each request and extend TTL on activity.
4. When user logs out or session expires, the session manager shall invalidate session and clean up related data.
5. If session data is corrupted or unavailable, then the session manager shall require re-authentication without exposing errors.

**Rationale:** Maintains user authentication state and project access context across requests.

**Traceability:** Links to design.md sections 3.2, 5.3

## Non-Functional Requirements

### PERF-001: Performance

**User Story Context:** As a system user, I want fast response times for cached operations, so that the application feels responsive and efficient.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. While Redis is operational, cache read operations shall complete within 5ms for 95% of requests.
2. When rate limit checks are performed, they shall complete within 2ms for 99% of requests.
3. While queue operations are executed, enqueue and dequeue operations shall complete within 10ms for 95% of requests.
4. When progress updates are stored, they shall complete within 3ms for 95% of requests.

**Rationale:** Ensures Redis operations meet performance requirements for responsive user experience.

### PERF-002: Memory Usage

**User Story Context:** As a system administrator, I want controlled memory usage by Redis, so that system resources are not exhausted and performance remains stable.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. While Redis is running, memory usage shall not exceed 512MB unless explicitly configured otherwise.
2. When memory reaches 80% of limit, Redis shall automatically evict least recently used keys.
3. While cleanup operations run, expired keys shall be removed within 60 seconds of expiration.
4. When memory pressure is detected, Redis shall log warnings and optionally reject write operations.

**Rationale:** Prevents memory exhaustion and maintains stable system performance.

### SEC-001: Security

**User Story Context:** As a security administrator, I want secure Redis access and data protection, so that sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. When Redis connections are established, they shall use AUTH password authentication with strong passwords.
2. While Redis is running, access shall be restricted to authorized services through network-level controls.
3. When sensitive data is stored in Redis, it shall be encrypted or encoded to prevent exposure.
4. When Redis operations are performed, they shall be logged for audit and security monitoring.
5. If unauthorized access attempts are detected, then Redis shall block the connections and alert administrators.

**Rationale:** Ensures Redis infrastructure meets security requirements and protects sensitive data.

### AVAIL-001: Availability

**User Story Context:** As a system user, I want Redis to be highly available, so that system functionality is not disrupted by Redis failures.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. While Redis is operational, it shall maintain 99.9% uptime during business hours.
2. When Redis becomes unavailable, the system shall gracefully degrade by falling back to direct database operations.
3. While Redis is recovering from failures, queued operations shall be preserved and processed after recovery.
4. When Redis health checks fail, the system shall alert administrators and attempt automatic recovery.

**Rationale:** Ensures system remains functional even when Redis experiences issues.

### RELI-001: Reliability

**User Story Context:** As a system operator, I want reliable Redis operations with proper error handling, so that data integrity is maintained and operations complete successfully.

**EARS Requirements:**

1. When Redis operations fail, the system shall implement retry logic with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts.
2. While queue tasks are processed, the system shall ensure task durability through atomic operations.
3. When Redis persistence is enabled, it shall save data to disk at least every 300 seconds.
4. When Redis restarts, it shall recover queued tasks and cached data according to persistence configuration.

**Rationale:** Ensures Redis operations are reliable and data is not lost during failures.
