# SSL Certificates for Development

This directory contains SSL certificates for development use.

## Development Certificates

For development purposes, you can generate self-signed certificates using:

```bash
# Generate private key
openssl genrsa -out jeex-dev.key 2048

# Generate certificate signing request
openssl req -new -key jeex-dev.key -out jeex-dev.csr -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=JEEX/CN=localhost"

# Generate self-signed certificate
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in jeex-dev.csr -signkey jeex-dev.key -out jeex-dev.crt

# Clean up CSR
rm jeex-dev.csr
```

## Usage

The certificates will be automatically generated by the setup script or can be generated manually as shown above.

**Note:** These certificates are for development only and should not be used in production.
